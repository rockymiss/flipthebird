## Version Control


### Git and GitHub 

Local repository and IDE used: GitPod
Remote repository used: GitHub

Steps followed: 
- I created a new public repository on GitHub using the Code Institute template.
- I then created a workspace and started coding on GitPod. 
- Pages were created along with assets folders and css style file. 
- As I worked I previewed changes using ports to open the browser.
- To save my work safely I continued to use the terminal consistently by using: 
    - **git add .** to add work to git
    - **git commit -m""** to commit the work 
    - **git push** to update work to GitHub 


### Deployment
